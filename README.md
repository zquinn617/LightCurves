# LightCurves
Various codes used to produce light curves for near Earth orbit asteroids.
Corrections for error in the telescope(Darkframe, Biasframe, Sky flat etc.) and data collection are done using AstroImageJ.
Background star analysis uses fluxuations in brightness of select background stars to correct for varying visibilty in the sky.
splicing nights together compares the relative brightness of select common stars and combines the data from multiple nights to be used in analysis.
The results from this code allow us to calculate the frequency at which an object in the night sky rotates.
